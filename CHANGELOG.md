## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Nether and End cramming.** The batch was keyed on game time alone,
  which every dimension shares, so the Nether and End skipped their
  batch whenever the Overworld had already run one that tick: no pushing
  and no cramming damage there. Batches are now keyed per dimension.
- **Cramming only from mobs that tick.** The batch pushed and damaged
  every loaded mob, including mobs in frozen chunks past simulation
  distance, mobs an activation-range mod such as ServerCore skips, and
  `/tick freeze`. Only mobs whose own `pushEntities` ran last tick now
  push, and each mob applies its own cramming damage from its own call.
- **Cramming push strength.** Vanilla pushes an overlapping pair from
  each ticking member's call, so two active mobs are pushed twice per
  tick; Ferrite pushed once. Pairs are now pushed once per ticking member.
- **Cramming above 2048 loaded mobs.** The overflow path cancelled vanilla
  without running a batch, so no mob in that dimension got cramming.
  Mobs now fall back to vanilla.

### Changed
- **Mob line-of-sight rays skip air.** Every sight check (target goals,
  brain sensors) is a block-by-block raycast that, for each block, looked
  up the block and fluid, built both shapes and clipped against them; for
  air that always ends in "no hit". The ray is now walked with a copy of
  vanilla's walk that reads blocks from the chunk section it last used and
  answers air at once; every other block, the hit and the miss result are
  computed as vanilla does. Only `LivingEntity.hasLineOfSight` takes this
  path; other rays keep vanilla's (or Lithium's) clip. CI bench (1000
  husks, 60 villagers behind glass, Lithium; rotated rounds): 0.56 and
  0.34 ms/tick faster with the skip over two runs, ahead in 8 of 9 rounds;
  line-of-sight checks took about 30% fewer profile samples. The oracle
  compared 250,371 rays with Lithium's clip and found no difference. `/ferrite raycast air-skip on|off|status`,
  `-Dferrite.clip.airskip=false`.
- **Path type lookups skip Fabric API's empty hook.** Fabric API's
  content-registries hook sits in `PathfindingContext.getPathTypeFromState`,
  the lookup behind every node a land pathfinder evaluates, ahead of
  vanilla's path type cache: a block lookup and a registry lookup per
  call, which only matter for blocks some mod registered. While nothing
  is registered (checked on every call) and no other mod hooks that
  method (checked once), Ferrite runs the method's vanilla body before
  the hook. In a same-run profile A/B (equal JFR windows), pathfinding
  took 60-64 samples per window with the shortcut and 95 without, and
  Fabric's hook (64 samples) no longer appears; across runs it fell from
  5.6-5.8% of the server thread to 3.1-3.3% (a later same-run window:
  55-63 samples with it, 102 without). MSPT is within the bench's noise:
  +0.11 and -0.35 ms/tick over two rotated runs.
  `/ferrite ai pathtype-bypass on|off|status`,
  `-Dferrite.ai.pathtypebypass=false`.
- **Lean mode with spark.** When spark is installed, about thirty
  timing-only mixins are left out at launch and monitor reports start
  off. `-Dferrite.diagnostics=true|false` or
  `/ferrite diagnostics on|off|auto` (saved, applied on restart)
  override it.
- **Pre-chunk loader off by default.** It never measured a TPS gain and
  loads chunks up to 16 past view distance for every moving player.
  `/ferrite prechunk on|off|status` (saved) or `-Dferrite.prechunk=true`;
  targets outside the world border are skipped.
- **Furnace ticker gate stands down under Lithium,** whose furnace
  sleeping already covers it. The sign gate is unchanged.
- **Rust worldgen state built on first use,** not at every boot; nothing
  on by default reads it. Worldgen, density, biome, noise, surface and
  aquifer commands build it on demand; `-Dferrite.worldgen.eager=true`
  restores the boot-time build.
- **Redstone oracle runs only while AC is on.** With AC off it compared
  vanilla with itself.
- **Monitors stop collecting while reports are off** for entity tick,
  mob phases, pathfinding and light, and no longer box a `Long` per
  entity per tick. The item-frame count no longer walks every entity
  every 5 s while nothing prints it.
- **Cramming asks `isPushable()` only of mobs that overlap another.** It
  costs a block lookup (`onClimbable`) and was asked of every loaded mob
  every tick; Rust only reads it for overlapping pairs. If an
  overlapping mob is not pushable (climbing, a bat), the batch runs
  again with its flag cleared, so results are unchanged.
- **Typed entity queries on large class buckets walk the section grid**
  instead of the bucket (`/ferrite entityquery typed-grid on|off|status`,
  `-Dferrite.entityquery.typedgrid=false`).
- **The collider skip checks hard colliders per entity section.** One
  parked boat used to stand the skip down for its whole dimension; now
  only for queries near it (`/ferrite entityquery collider-sections
  on|off|status`, `-Dferrite.entityquery.collidersections=false`).
- **The per-move entity index callback does less:** its monitor counts
  only while reports are on, and the grid moves an entity only when it
  changes cell.

### Removed
- **Hopper extract hint maintenance.** It updated a hint on every
  container change, but the hopper hooks that read it were not carried
  into the 26.x ports. `/ferrite hopper highway` now says the hopper
  layer is not in 26.x builds.
- **Biome route and prewarm.** The route mixin named a Yarn-era method
  and never attached under Mojmap; prewarm only fed it. Not retargeted,
  since it would bypass Biolith's biome placement.
- **Physics hooks by default.** The `Entity.move` collide redirect and
  pre-tick hook load only with `-Dferrite.physics.hooks=true`; nothing
  turns the physics port on.

### Measured
- On the CI bench, Ferrite's cramming batch against vanilla's
  `pushEntities`: 3.62 and 2.99 ms/tick faster over two rotated runs
  (10.07 against 13.70, and 8.69 against 11.68), ahead in all 9 rounds;
  earlier runs on other runners gave 1.4 to 3.2 ms.
- Tried and dropped: a flat copy of each brain's behavior table (for
  villagers and other brain mobs). It was exact, but measured 0.46
  ms/tick slower in all five rotated rounds and slower in a same-run
  profile, so it is not in the build.
- With Lithium installed, turning the entity query index's queries off
  measured -0.1, +0.1 and +0.7 ms/tick over three runs, so it stays on
  with no consistent gain; the typed grid and the per-section collider
  skip measured within 0.2 ms.

### CI
- Rust tests run on every push, and a headless dedicated-server smoke
  test boots the mod in full and lean mode, fails on mixin errors, and
  checks cramming damage in the Overworld and the Nether.
- **Benchmark job** (commit tag `[bench]` or a manual run): a dedicated
  server with Lithium, 1000 husks (a spread pen and a 200-mob pile), 60
  villagers and a parked boat, measured with `/tick query` over
  interleaved A/B arms, plus a JFR profile summarised per method
  (`scripts/JfrHot.java`). It fails on any oracle mismatch.
- **Inspect job** (commit tag `[inspect]`): prints `javap -c` of the
  vanilla methods listed in `scripts/inspect-targets.txt`, so mixins can
  be checked against this version's bytecode.

## [0.7.4-alpha] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **Declared loader minimum was wrong** (#17). 0.7.3 was built against
  Fabric Mixin 0.17.4, which compiles every `@Redirect` `at` as an
  array. MixinExtras 0.5.4, bundled in Loader 0.19.3 and 0.19.4, cannot
  read that shape and the game crashed at launch with a
  ClassCastException on the first Entity mixin. Loader 0.19.5 bundles
  MixinExtras 0.5.5, which reads it. The manifest now requires
  `fabricloader >=0.19.5`, so an older loader reports a dependency
  error instead of crashing.

## [0.7.3-alpha] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Chunkforce auto mode, default off.** Engages forced generation
  when a player sustains ~40 blocks/s; `/ferrite chunkforce auto on`.
  Off by default: a 10-run interleaved bench at 90 blocks/s measured
  8.1 missing chunks against vanilla's 0.9, worse in every pair.
- **`/ferrite arrival` monitor, `/ferrite arrival bench` and
  `/ferrite arrival suite`.** Counts unloaded chunks inside each view
  distance every 5 s (~50 us/tick at view distance 10), plus an
  automated flight bench. `-Pferrite.autobench=x,z,speed,seconds,runs`
  runs a suite headless.
- **`/ferrite probe stages` and `/ferrite pregen order`.** Per-stage
  wall timer on the chunk pipeline and a selectable pregen request
  order (ring, scan, diag). Diagnostics only, default off; readings
  are in docs/JOURNEY.md.

### Fixed

- **Own nametag missing in F5 with nametag mods** (#15). A leftover
  client mixin blanked the local player display name. Removed.

### Changed

- **Entity query index and collider skip are now default on.** Opt-in
  since 0.7.0. Evidence: 10.8M oracle checks with zero mismatches, and
  a 1022-zombie farm on a shared 4-core server going from 15.5 TPS to
  a locked 20 TPS. Kill switches: `-Dferrite.entityquery.cache=false`
  and `-Dferrite.entityquery.colliderskip=false`. With Lithium
  installed the gain is smaller; the two coexist.
- **Lower default-config footprint** (26.2.x dev build, JDK 25, jcmd;
  commands in docs/PIANO_STATUS.md):
  - ~4.4 MB of off-heap physics buffers no longer allocate while
    physics is off.
  - Rust worker pool starts on first use instead of at the title
    screen: zero idle native threads, was 6.
  - Cramming reuses its spatial hash buckets across ticks.
  - Two leaks closed: parity-capture lists cleared on server stop, and
    the opt-in nav cache frees native memory on chunk unload.
  - Monitors stop timing entities while reports are off, removing
    ~100k allocations/s at horde scale. No measurable mspt change on a
    24-core desktop; the saving is GC pressure and slow-CPU time.
- **Fabric Loader 0.19.5** in the dev and CI build. This entry
  originally said the minimum stays 0.18.4; that was wrong, see the
  Unreleased fix above.

## [Released]

## [0.7.2-alpha] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Moonrise compatibility crash at boot** (#12). Moonrise replaces
  the vanilla light engine internals, which removed the injection
  targets of the two ThreadedLevelLightEngine diagnostic mixins and
  hard-crashed the game at init. A mixin config plugin now detects
  Moonrise and skips those two mixins; for now the `[light]` monitor
  reports no data when Moonrise is installed, since Moonrise owns
  lighting at that point. A Moonrise-aware light probe may come
  later. Verified against Moonrise 1.1.0: boot, existing-world play,
  and fresh world creation all clean.

### Changed

- **Monitor logging defaults off on small heaps.** Max heap of 3 GB
  or less (Pi-class servers, often on slow SD-card I/O) now boots
  with the periodic monitor reports silenced instead of paying ~5
  log lines/sec. Counters still run; `/ferrite log monitors on` or
  `-Dferrite.log.monitors.on=true` re-enables at any time. Normal
  heaps keep the old default.
- **Dispatch and oracle telemetry respects the small-heap monitor
  default** (PR #10, contributed by cwright814). The
  `[cramming-dispatch]`, `[physics-dispatch]`, `[redstone-oracle]`,
  and `[chunkgen-features]` periodic lines predate MonitorLog and
  bypassed it; on a Pi-class server they were most of the log file.
  Now routed through MonitorLog, so heaps of 3 GB or less boot with
  them silenced and `/ferrite log monitors on` re-enables them.

### Added

- **Per-category log muting** (#14). `/ferrite log <category> off`
  silences one monitor tag (`physics-dispatch`, `cramming-dispatch`,
  `redstone-oracle`, and every other bracket tag) without touching
  the rest; `on` resumes it on the next report window and
  `/ferrite log status` lists what is muted. Counters keep running
  while muted. The global `/ferrite log monitors` switch is
  unchanged.
- **Module toggles persist across restarts** (#13). Cramming, the
  hopper layer, AC redstone, monitor logging, and muted log
  categories now save to `config/ferrite.properties` on every
  toggle and reload at boot. The file stores only deviations from
  defaults, so it stays empty (absent, in fact) until something is
  changed, and reverting a toggle removes its line. Diagnostic and
  experiment flags stay session-only on purpose, as does prewarm,
  since enabling it during boot breaks spawn loading.

- **Entity spatial query index** (opt-in,
  `-Dferrite.entityquery.cache=true`). Sections holding 32+ entities
  get a per-section bitset grid (4-block cells); box queries visit
  only candidate entities in vanilla iteration order, so consumer
  order, abort semantics, and mid-tick liveness are preserved
  exactly. At a 1022-zombie farm: query cost 14.4-16.8 down to
  10.3 ms/tick (34% cut), whole-server mspt 36-40 down to ~32.7,
  zero oracle mismatches across 83,000+ sampled queries. Default
  off pending broader soak; `-Dferrite.entityquery.oracle=<1-in-N>`
  enables field validation.
- **`-Dferrite.pregen.inflight=<n>`** sets the pre-gen inflight cap
  at boot (dedicated servers and headless benches; the runtime
  command still overrides). While adding it, the 200 default was
  re-validated on a constrained 4-core / 2 GB profile: 42.8 chunks/s
  vs 34.8 at cap 50, the same relationship as on desktop hardware,
  so the default stands on weak CPUs too.
- **One-line hardware stamp at boot**: `[hw] arch cores maxHeap jvm
  native monitors`, so shared log excerpts self-describe the host
  they came from. Field reports from low-end hardware no longer
  need follow-up questions about specs.
- **`[entity-tick] misc-top` breakdown.** When the misc entity
  bucket has a tick over 5 ms in a window, a second line names the
  top three entity types by time (total, worst single entity,
  count). Prompted by a Raspberry Pi field report (PR #8) where
  misc spiked to 47.8 ms with no way to tell which entity type was
  responsible.

## [0.7.1-alpha] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- **`/ferrite biome validate` compared against the wrong dimension.**
  The validator used whichever biome source was constructed last,
  which is the nether's, so the in-game command reported a screaming
  0/2000 with all-nether answers while the boot-time validator was
  fine. It now picks the captured source whose biome set contains
  plains. The long-standing 1999/2000 was also diagnosed and closed:
  an exact fitness tie between lush_caves and dripstone_caves at a
  climate point real terrain never produces; vanilla and Ferrite
  break the tie in different but equally valid orders. No in-game
  effect.

### Changed

- **Fat LTO release profile for the native library.** The workspace
  had no release profile at all; `lto = "fat"` plus
  `codegen-units = 1` cuts the Windows dll from 2.1 MB to 794 KB
  (cross-crate dead code eliminated), with debuginfo stripped but
  the symbol table kept so native crash reports stay readable.
  Parity re-verified on the LTO build: noise 63/63, density 50/50
  bit-exact, biome 1999/2000 (the documented tie). No
  `panic = "abort"`: unwinding is what lets a native panic fall
  back to vanilla instead of killing the server. In-game A/B at a
  1022-zombie cramming farm: 38-41 ms/tick LTO vs 37-40 ms/tick old
  profile, within noise; perf-neutral, kept for the size win.
- **Removed the aarch64 to x86_64 native fallback** in the loader:
  a wrong-arch library can never load, so the fallback only
  replaced an honest "not bundled for this platform" log with a
  misleading "failed to load" one.

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-07-27

### Known issues

- Biome parity reads 1999/2000 in the validator: the one miss is an
  exact fitness tie between lush_caves and dripstone_caves at a
  climate point outside the range real terrain produces (validator
  samples wider than the game's climate space). Vanilla and Ferrite
  break the tie in different but equally valid orders. No in-game
  effect; real climate points match 100%.
- The deep-marker diagnostic walk registers no interior cache
  routes on 26.2. Affects default-off diagnostics only; no live
  path reads those fingerprints.

### Added

- **Linux aarch64 native support** (PR #8, contributed by cwright814,
  tested on a Raspberry Pi 4B). The jar now bundles a fourth native
  built by a new CI cross-compile job; `RustBridge` picks it by
  `os.arch` at load time, and local Gradle builds on ARM hosts target
  it automatically. Verified in the field: a full server on a 2GB
  Pi 4B under OpenJ9 with memory to spare.
- **Building-from-source section in the README**: toolchain
  prerequisites per platform, the one-command Gradle build, and what a
  locally built jar bundles versus the CI release jars.
- **Pre-gen now skips chunks that are already generated.** Before
  paying a ticket and a FULL-status promotion, the driver checks the
  live chunk holder, then stream-scans the region file for just the
  chunk's Status field (no full deserialize). Re-running pre-gen over
  existing terrain completes at thousands of chunks per second instead
  of re-loading every chunk from disk; measured 289/289 skipped
  sub-second on a fully generated area, with virgin-generation
  throughput unchanged. Skip counts show in `/ferrite pregen status`.

### Fixed

- **An unreadable region file no longer makes pre-gen skip chunks.**
  If the Status scan failed (locked file, IO worker shutting down, a
  region the reader cannot open), the chunk was treated as already
  generated and silently left ungenerated. The scan now fails open:
  it names the chunk in the log and generates it. Verified by holding
  an exclusive lock on a region file during a 121-chunk run, which
  produced 121 warnings and 121 generated chunks instead of 121 silent
  skips. Chunks whose generation itself fails are logged too, rather
  than counted as done.
- **Malformed IntervalSelect nodes now stop the walker instead of
  encoding wrong caves.** A density function node whose threshold and
  child counts disagree used to encode as a degenerate node, which
  reads as valid bytecode and produces wrong cave terrain with no
  error anywhere. The walker now rejects it and says what it saw.
  Every IntervalSelect in the live 26.2 registry passes; density
  parity stays 50/50 bit-exact at 2000 samples.

## [0.6.6-alpha] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Five latent redstone defects found in a full review of the AC
  port.** An exception mid-cascade left stale graph state that poisoned
  every later cascade in that world; removed wires reached the Rust BFS
  kernel as phantom power-15 sources through a sign-truncation bug (this
  path is default-on); an out-of-range power value could abort the whole
  JVM via a release-mode panic across the JNI boundary (now hard-clamped
  on both sides); the parity oracle produced guaranteed false positives
  on experimental-redstone worlds (now skipped); and a single exception
  permanently disabled the oracle and phase counters through stuck
  thread-locals (they self-heal every tick now). None of these changed
  measured performance; all validators stay bit-exact.

### Changed

- **AC redstone survived its first real lag machine on 26.1.2.** The
  vanilla path held 1.4-1.8 TPS (up to 716 ms per tick); enabling
  `/ferrite redstone ac on` mid-choke recovered to a flat 20.00 TPS in
  about 40 seconds, ~13x fewer cascades and ~6x cheaper gate updates on
  the same build. README benchmark section carries the numbers.

- **Chunkforce predicts flight direction.** With `/ferrite chunkforce
  on`, the force-gen ring center now leads a moving player by up to 12
  chunks along their velocity instead of spending half the budget on
  terrain behind them. Flight test on 26.1.2 (view distance 16,
  simulation distance 12): 24,581 chunks forced in ~2.5 minutes at
  ~160 chunks/s with TPS 20.00 held; the generation front stays out
  of sight at top creative-fly speed. Stationary players keep the old
  radial behavior.
- **Pregen inflight cap raised 50 to 200 (+25% throughput).** Four
  3721-chunk virgin-terrain runs measured cap 50 at 90-96 chunks/s and
  cap 200 at 114-118 chunks/s; 400 added nothing. Tunable at runtime
  with `/ferrite pregen inflight <n>`.
- **Walkability cache: fill strategy fixed, then shelved after A/B.**
  Session 5's pre-fill box thrashed the 512-slot cache (hit rate 1-17%,
  ~4400 snapshots per 5 s). Session 6 replaced it with a lazy snapshot on
  first miss, restricted to sections the PathNavigationRegion actually
  backs, and grew the kind cache to 2-way set-associative (2048 sets x 2
  ways, LRU). That fixed the cache itself: hit rate 71-94%, snapshots
  24-57 per 5 s. An A/B with 294 chasing zombies then hit 84-87% and
  still moved nav tick cost at most ~5%, inside noise, because vanilla already
  fronts `getPathTypeFromState` with a per-position `PathTypeCache` and
  our intercept only ever serves vanilla's misses. Shelved: code stays in
  tree, default off, post-mortem in JOURNEY. Opt in with
  `-Dferrite.nav.cache=true`, or `-Pferrite.navCache=true` /
  `-Pferrite.navParity=true` on runClient.

### Added

- **`[chunk-save]` monitor.** Times `SerializableChunkData.copyOf` (server
  thread) and `write` (background encode) separately, one line per 5 s
  window when saves happened. First measurements settled the chunk-save
  port candidate: the palette bit-pack already runs on the background
  executor in 26.1.x, and the tick thread pays only 0.3-0.5 ms/tick of
  copyOf under sustained flight. Candidate closed; monitor stays.

### Fixed

- **Workspace is clippy-clean.** All ~120 warnings cleared across the four
  crates: `bind!` codegen now emits `From` impls without the Copy
  `.clone()`, the api layer's `Into` impls flipped to `From`, slice params
  replace `&Vec`, and dead verbatim-port items carry explicit allows.
  Style lints that fight the vanilla ports (index loops, negated float
  comparisons that keep vanilla NaN semantics, JNI argument counts) are
  allowed at crate level in rust-mod with a justification comment.
  Workspace resolver pinned to 2; the macros crate declares
  `proc-macro = true` instead of `crate-type`.

- **Unsafe JNI buffer helpers hardened.** `get_i32_slice_mut`
  (surface_jni.rs) and `get_byte_slice_mut` (redstone_queues_jni.rs)
  returned `&mut [_]` from a shared `&JByteBuffer`, so nothing stopped a
  caller from holding two aliased mutable slices over one direct buffer.
  Never a live bug (each is called once per JNI call), but the invariant
  was unwritten. Both are now `unsafe fn` with a `# Safety` contract
  (no-alias, capacity, alignment) and SAFETY notes at each call site. The
  two `clippy::mut_from_ref` errors are gone, and build.yml now runs
  clippy on the linux job so deny-level lints fail CI.

## [0.6.5-alpha] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- **Walkability cache default off.** `-Dferrite.nav.cache` now defaults to
  `false`. Session 5's first live counters showed the pre-fill box thrashing
  the 512-slot direct-mapped cache (hit rate 1-17%, ~4400 snapshots per 5 s,
  net regression in casual play). The default path stays vanilla until the
  session 6 fill-strategy fix lands; set `-Dferrite.nav.cache=true` to opt in
  for measurement.

### Added

- **Walkability cache session 4.** `WalkNodeEvaluatorMixin` intercepts
  `WalkNodeEvaluator.getPathTypeFromState(BlockGetter, BlockPos)` at HEAD.
  For sections already snapshotted, returns `PathType` directly from a
  Java-side direct-mapped section cache (512 slots, ~5-10 ns per lookup)
  instead of calling `level.getBlockState` followed by the 50-line
  classification chain.  The Java-side cache is filled in `snapshotSection`
  alongside the Rust store and evicted on block-kind changes.

  `kindToPathType` maps the unambiguous kinds: AIR/LADDER/SCAFFOLDING/CARPET
  to OPEN; OPAQUE_FULL/SLAB/STAIRS to BLOCKED; FENCE/WALL to FENCE;
  TRAPDOOR to TRAPDOOR; WATER to WATER; LAVA to LAVA; LEAVES to LEAVES.
  DOOR, FENCE_GATE, and OTHER fall through to vanilla (state-dependent).

  `encodeBlockKind` now redirects MAGMA_BLOCK, HONEY_BLOCK, POWDER_SNOW,
  lit campfires, and LAVA_CAULDRON to KIND_OTHER to prevent false BLOCKED
  returns for those blocks.

  Parity correction: `LiquidBlock.isPathfindable(LAND)` is `true` in 26.1.x
  (water blocks return `PathType.WATER`, not BLOCKED).  Updated
  `kindToPathType` and `predictCategory` accordingly.

- **Walkability cache session 5: A/B flags and hit-rate counters.**
  `-Dferrite.nav.cache` (default true) gates the whole cache for clean
  vanilla-baseline measurement runs; `-Dferrite.nav.parity` (default false)
  gates the parity validator, which had been running per-node JNI and string
  work on every ground-mob findPath after validation was already complete.
  Hit/ambiguous/miss/snapshot counters in `NavigationCacheBridge` feed a
  `[nav-cache]` line in the 5 s monitor report, so measurement runs report
  hit rate alongside timing deltas.

### Fixed

- **Nav-cache snapshot gate desync.** The section-snapshot gate in
  `PathFinderMixin` checked the Rust store while the hot path reads the
  Java 512-slot kind cache. A slot collision or door eviction emptied the
  Java slot while Rust still reported cached, so the section never refilled
  and went permanently cold. The gate now checks the Java cache
  (`hasJavaSection`), which also drops the per-section JNI call from the
  pre-fill loop.

- **Asymmetric door eviction.** Placing or removing a door evicted the Java
  cache slot but not the Rust section store (empty match arms in
  `nav_cache.rs`). Eviction is now symmetric: any kind-crossing change
  evicts both stores; door open/close (DOOR to DOOR) is still filtered.

- **Snapshot box could cache wrong-AIR sections.** The pre-fill bounding box
  extended past the chunks `PathNavigationRegion` actually backs, where the
  region serves `EmptyLevelChunk` (all AIR). Those sections were cached as
  permanently wrong AIR data invisible to the parity gate, which only checks
  in-region path nodes. The box is now clamped to region-backed chunks (new
  `PathNavigationRegionAccessor`) and world build height, and null
  `getChunkNow` entries are skipped.

### Direction

First live data from the new counters: hit rate 1-17% with snapshots
sustained at ~4400 per 5 s window, often exceeding lookups. Each findPath
pre-fills its whole bounding box and the boxes thrash the 512-slot
direct-mapped cache, so most fills are evicted before serving a lookup.
Session 6 fixes the fill strategy (lazy per-section snapshot on miss, or a
larger/associative cache) before the planned A/B measurement scenarios run;
measuring the current build would measure the artifact.

## [0.6.4-alpha] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Dispatcher latency probe** (`/ferrite probe dispatcher on`, default off).
  Captures queue-wait per priority lane and per-task wall time on the
  worldgen and light executors. Measurement on fast-flight load: task body
  is 4-10x the dispatcher's worst tail, so the dispatcher is not the
  bottleneck. Probe stays in tree for re-measurement under other workloads.

- **Walkability cache infrastructure (sessions 1-3).** Block-kind cache for
  the pathfinding subsystem: Rust section store (4096-cell flat arrays, evict
  on block change), JNI surface, Java bridge with 18-category block classifier,
  lazy section fill on path requests, and a parity gate that validates cache
  predictions against vanilla's node evaluator. Parity result: 6 critical
  mismatches out of hundreds of nodes checked per session (all structural
  2-block-model limits). The performance swap (session 4) is the follow-on.

### Removed

- Dead `SurfaceValidator.onServerTick` method and its fields (zero callers).

### Internal

- Threading audit (`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`): three-tier safety classification
  of every non-final static field on worldgen and entity-tick paths, plus
  Rust-side concurrency posture (zero unsafe statics, zero plain cells).
- Doc index (`docs/DOC_MAP.md`) and various doc updates across JOURNEY,
  FUTURE_PLANS, and per-subsystem writeups.

## [0.6.3-alpha] — 2026-05-03

### Added

- AC offer-based Rust kernel (`/ferrite redstone ac-rust on`).
  Mirrors AC's `powerNetwork()` loop in Rust: offer-based propagation
  with flow-direction tracking, priority-queue ordered output.
  Parity-clean (0 oracle mismatches sustained across Phase 3
  validation). **~16% aggregate wire-cost reduction** vs the
  existing relaxation kernel on heavy workloads.

  Per-bucket vs relaxation kernel (lag-machine measurement):
  ```
  1-4 wires:  tied (JNI dispatch dominates at this size)
  5-8 wires:  1.20x faster
  9-16 wires: 2.09x faster
  ```

  Default OFF, requires both AC and AC-Rust enabled:
  ```
  /ferrite redstone ac on
  /ferrite redstone ac-rust on
  ```

  Will flip default-on in a future release after a full alpha cycle
  of clean user reports. Oracle validation opt-in via
  `-Dferrite.redstone.ac.validate=true`.

### Notes

- Existing relaxation kernel (`RUST_BFS`) stays in tree as fallback.
  Both kernels coexist; AC-Rust activates first when enabled, BFS
  takes over if the AC path bails (overflow / native unavailable).
- Phase 3 depower fix: `runRustAcBatch()` now calls
  `findPower(wire, true)` after `findExternalPower()` to pull
  outside-cascade wire contributions before serializing. Fixes
  boundary wire power=0 mismatches the oracle surfaced during
  initial validation (~5% mismatch rate before fix, 0 after).

## [0.6.2-alpha] — 2026-05-03

Completes the block-entity ticker hygiene story started in 0.6.1.
0.6.1 fixed signs; 0.6.2 fixes furnaces and unifies the gate
infrastructure so future ticker suppressions are additive instead
of conflicting.

### Performance

- **Idle furnaces, blast furnaces, and smokers no longer tick** when
  empty and not burning. Vanilla registers a `BlockEntityTicker` for
  every furnace at chunk load; the body does nothing useful when
  `litTimeRemaining == 0 && cookingTimer == 0` and both fuel and
  input slots are empty. Suppression gates `LevelChunk.updateBlockEntityTicker`
  via `@Redirect` on `BlockState.getTicker`, returning
  null for the three vanilla types (strict-class check) when all four
  conditions hold. Re-registers via `@Inject RETURN` on
  `setItem(int, ItemStack)`. Measured at 500 idle furnaces:
  **zero measurable BE-tick increase** vs the empty-area baseline
  (0.04-0.05 ms / tick pre and post, within noise floor). Default-on.
  Mod subclasses untouched.

### Changed

- **Sign and furnace ticker gates collapsed into one composite mixin**
  (`WorldChunkBlockEntityTickerGateMixin`). Two separate `@Redirect`
  mixins on the same INVOKE site conflict at load time, Mixin keeps
  the first-loaded one and silently skips the second. Caught at boot
  via the `[Mixin/WARN]` line on the first dev build. The composite
  gate has both sign and furnace cases as independent branches;
  future BE-type suppressions add as additional branches.

### Notes

- Audited the rest of vanilla's common block entities (chest, barrel,
  bed, decorated pot, lectern, jukebox, comparator, piston). Mojang
  already applied the dynamic-ticker pattern correctly to all of them.
  Signs and furnaces were the two outliers. Both now closed. The
  cheap obvious targets are exhausted; further tick-cost reductions
  will be measurement-driven from real server logs rather than source
  scans of vanilla.

- Brewing stand `getSlotsEmpty()` allocates `boolean[3]` per tick.
  Realistic-scale impact (30 stands → 14 KB/sec GC pressure) is below
  TPS-relevant. Fix shape (three coordinated `@Redirect` on a 40-line
  method) is brittle and outweighs the savings. Deferred to
  `docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md`. Revisit if a real server surfaces brewing
  stand tick cost as measurable.

## [0.6.1-alpha] — 2026-05-03

Consolidation release. Builds on 0.6.0's hopper highway and pre-gen
with audit-driven correctness, perf cleanups, and a sign-tick fix.

### Performance

- **Sign block entities no longer tick when no player is actively
  editing them.** Vanilla registers a `BlockEntityTicker` for every
  sign at chunk load. The body is one null check on the
  playerWhoMayEdit field (useful only while a player has the edit
  screen open), but the per-tick infrastructure (range check, ticker
  map walk, lambda dispatch, profiler push/pop) costs ~120 ns per
  sign per tick regardless. Fix gates `LevelChunk.updateBlockEntityTicker`
  via `@Redirect` on `BlockState.getTicker`, returning null for vanilla
  `SignBlockEntity` and `HangingSignBlockEntity` (strict-class check)
  with `getPlayerWhoMayEdit() == null`. Vanilla's existing
  `if (ticker == null) removeBlockEntityTicker(...)` branch handles
  deregistration. `SignBlockEntity.setAllowedPlayerEditor(UUID)`
  re-evaluates the gate via the chunk invoker the moment the editor
  field flips. Measured on 961 placed signs:
  **0.20 ms / tick → 0.06 ms / tick (~70% reduction)**. Default-on.
  Mod subclasses untouched. Self-heals from persisted-editor state
  within 2 ticks of chunk load.

- **Cramming Rust kernel: thread-local FxHashMap reuse + small-N
  brute-force fast path.** Spatial-hash structure now persists across
  ticks instead of allocating per call (`fxhash` crate added). Below
  16 mobs, a brute-force O(N²) sweep beats hash setup. Both default-
  on. No behavior change.

- **Cramming monitor inject gated on dispatcher state.** When the
  Rust dispatcher is enabled, the timing mixin's HEAD/RETURN injects
  early-return instead of running monitor work that would never be
  observed (the vanilla body is cancelled). Eliminates ~6,000
  `CallbackInfo` allocations per tick at 2,000 mobs.

- **Redstone Rust kernel: thread-local `Vec<u8>` buffer reuse.**
  Eliminates per-cascade allocation in the relaxation loop on the
  AC `runRustBatch` path. Same pattern as the cramming kernel fix.

### Correctness

- **Cramming: standalone vehicles no longer push their own
  passengers.** The Java side now sets `rootVehicleId = e.getId()`
  for entities with no vehicle (mirroring vanilla's
  `getRootVehicle() == self`), so equality alone covers both
  same-vehicle pairs and vehicle⇄passenger pairs. Pre-fix, the
  `-1` sentinel for standalone vehicles never matched the
  passenger's `vehicle.getId()`, leaving the pair processed and
  the passenger pushed by its own mount. Validated by a new
  `vehicle_does_not_push_its_own_passenger` Rust unit test.

- **Redstone: once-per-world warning when AC is enabled on an
  experimental-redstone world.** Vanilla's `RedstoneWireBlock.update`
  routes to `new ExperimentalRedstoneController(...).update(...)`
  before reaching `this.redstoneController.update(...)` when the
  world has the `redstone_experiments` feature flag set, so AC's
  installed controller never sees the cascade. The warning surfaces
  the silent-bypass case so users know `/ferrite redstone ac on`
  has no effect on that world. Deduped per `RegistryKey<World>`.

### Removed

- **`RedstoneRustDispatcher` and its `RedstoneRustMixin` deleted
  (~500 LOC).** Superseded by `WireHandler.runRustBatch` in 0.4.0;
  default-off `USE_RUST` toggle since. The
  `/ferrite redstone rust on|off|status` subcommand and
  `RedstoneHandoff.USE_RUST` field also removed. Buffer infrastructure
  shared with the live `runRustBatch` path stays in
  `RedstoneHandoff`.

### Fixed

- **README + project memory: AC and Rust BFS shipping defaults
  documented correctly.** AC ships default-off (user opt-in via
  `/ferrite redstone ac on`); Rust BFS is default-on but unreachable
  until AC is enabled. README line 56 was reading as if AC were on
  by default; corrected. Code and the user-facing defaults table
  were always correct, only the prose around them needed alignment.

### Added

- **`[sign-tick]` diagnostic line.** Reports `signs=N/tick`,
  per-call body time, and total body time per 5-second window when
  signs actually tick. Used to validate the suppression fix; kept
  in tree as a regression detector.

### Notes

- Two audit findings turned out to be false alarms on closer reading
  of vanilla source. (1) A `@Redirect` on `RedstoneController.update`
  was claimed to catch both the experimental and default branches,
  opening a hidden footgun; javac's invokevirtual receiver type
  (`ExperimentalRedstoneController`, not the parent) means Mixin's
  descriptor-based match never fires on the experimental branch. The
  redirect already worked correctly. (2) The per-wire
  `findExternalPower` call in `runRustBatch` was claimed redundant
  vs AC-Java's selective call; tracing the lazy-resolution semantics
  showed Rust takes a static snapshot and can't reproduce AC's
  deferred priority-queue resolution, so the per-wire call is
  necessary correctness work. Both would have shipped regressions if
  patched. See [docs/JOURNEY.md](docs/JOURNEY.md) "The May 2026 audit
  pass" for the retrospective.

- AC fidelity audit confirmed Ferrite's Alternate Current port is a
  faithful adaptation of [Space Walker's upstream](https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current)
  at commit `89609e4` (2026-03-23). No upstream changes to backport;
  full algorithmic parity preserved modulo correct yarn renames.
  Three Ferrite-side improvements (`rustIndex`, `head()` accessor,
  scratch buffer pre-alloc) verified present. Documented in
  [docs/REDSTONE_PORT_PLAN.md](docs/REDSTONE_PORT_PLAN.md) "Fidelity
  audit".

- Redstone `RUST_BFS_MIN_NODES = 1` default investigated and kept.
  Per-bucket measurement on a parallel-repeater farm showed Rust
  losing 1.48× in the 9-16 bucket but winning 1.29× and 1.50× in
  1-4 and 5-8. Aggregate wall-time per second is lower with Rust on
  every cascade than with any threshold tested. Per-cascade losses
  in narrow buckets get drowned out by aggregate wins on the wider
  distribution. Documented in [docs/JOURNEY.md](docs/JOURNEY.md).

## [0.6.0-alpha] — 2026-05-03

### Features

- **World creation pre-generation (default OFF toggle).** New "Pre-generate spawn area" toggle + radius slider (5-50 chunks) on the Create World "More" tab. When enabled, a background-thread driver walks a concentric annulus iterator around spawn after `SERVER_STARTED` and feeds chunks through vanilla's ticket API with a `Semaphore(50)` backpressure cap. A boss bar reports progress to the host. Cancel writes `<world>/ferrite_pregen.dat`; the next world load auto-resumes from the saved iterator state. Graceful completion deletes the snapshot and writes `<world>/ferrite_pregen.done` (also the first-launch gate for the dedicated-server `-Dferrite.pregen.radius=N` property). Test commands `/ferrite pregen <radius>`, `/ferrite pregen at <cx> <cz> <radius>`, `/ferrite pregen cancel`, `/ferrite pregen status`. Validated: 53-104 chunks/sec depending on server load (steady-state around 80/s with no contention; ~50/s when competing with active player chunkforce; ~100/s when chunkforce is on but inactive in the pre-gen area). TPS 20.00 holding under active flight + pre-gen load (max ticks under the 50ms budget). Coexists with `/ferrite chunkforce`: graceful throughput split when both target the same region, no TPS loss, no corruption. Iterator is clean-room (Chunky GPL-3.0 was mined for intent, not code).

### Migration to Minecraft 26.1.2

- **Mojmap port.** Bulk class/method/package translation from yarn 1.21.11 to mojmap 26.1.2 across 166 source files. Architectury Loom + `disableObfuscation=true` consumes a pre-deobfed jar from NeoForge maven; no Loom remap step.
- **JDK 25.** MC 26.1.2 mandates Java 25; build.yml provisions it via `actions/setup-java` (Temurin distribution).
- **Fabric API 0.147.0+26.1.2.** Per-level lifecycle hooks (`ServerWorldEvents` → `ServerLevelEvents`) and `ServerChunkEvents.Load` now fire on the renamed accessors; reflective probes in the worldgen bootstrap accept both mojmap and yarn names so future drift is absorbed.
- **Density function port: 50/50 bit-exact** vs vanilla on 26.1.2 at samples=2000, beating the 1.21.11 baseline of 41/42. New variants `FindTopSurface` (overworld/caves/noodle) and `EndIslandDensityFunction` (end/sloped_cheese) are now interpreted in Rust; `SimplexNoise` (2D) and `LegacyRandomSource` (java.util.Random LCG) added as Rust building blocks. The bigger win surfaced during the port was a single yarn-name-drift bug in `resolveNoiseName` that had silently zeroed every Noise leaf and was hiding 41 working DFs as failures; fixing it lifted parity from 5/50 to 41/50, and the new ports closed the rest.
- **Walker now handles `private record` DF types.** `Class.getMethod` + `invoke` silently fails on private records (auto-generated accessor is public but the declaring class is unexported, so invoke throws IllegalAccessException). Walker now uses `getDeclaredMethod` + `setAccessible(true)`.
- **Autovalidate harness.** `./gradlew runClient -Pferrite.autovalidate=N` now boots the client headlessly via Mojang's `--quickPlaySingleplayer`, runs noise + biome + density parity validators at sample count N, and exits. Roughly 35 seconds end-to-end. Plain `./gradlew runClient` still goes to the title screen.
- **16 diagnostic mixins stubbed.** Default-off in 1.21.11 already; need redesign against renamed 26.1.2 APIs. **One exception:** the `MaterialRuleContext` invoker/accessor pair was the 1.21.11 chunkgen baseline win (~3 ms/chunk default-on) and that surface does not exist on 26.1.2 — the renamed `Context` class doesn't expose the same hot fields/methods. The pair is gated out of `ferrite.mixins.json` on this branch; the win does not carry over.

### Logging

- **`/ferrite log monitors on|off|status`** — runtime gate for the periodic monitor reports (`[entity-tick]`, `[chunkgen]`, `[redstone-phase]`, etc.). About 5 lines/sec across 24 buckets in normal play, plus the disk I/O. Added preemptively to avoid log-volume lag on long sessions and on hardware where I/O is the bottleneck. JVM-arg equivalent: `-Dferrite.log.monitors.off=true`. Counters keep ticking when disabled, so re-enabling picks up cleanly from the next 5s window — no backlog dump. Also applied on the 1.21.11 branch.

## [0.5.1-alpha] — 2026-04-29

### Performance

- **Vanilla surface phase ~3 ms faster — applies to every user, no toggle.**
  Replaced the per-call `getClass().getMethod(...).invoke(...)` reflection
  in `SurfaceValidatorMixin`'s `captureContext` redirect (firing ~30K
  times per chunk during SURFACE phase, on every chunk regardless of
  Ferrite settings) with `@Invoker` mixins on
  `MaterialRules.MaterialRuleContext.initVerticalContext` and
  `BlockStateRule.tryApply` (commit `4ed0d89`). Vanilla's per-chunk
  surface baseline drops from ~9.3 ms to ~6.4 ms across the same
  measurement methodology — universal win, ships invisibly.
  Subsequent `@Accessor` cleanup on hot fields + three more
  `@Invoker`s for protected methods on the same class (commit
  `2beaa5b`) shipped clean code with parity-clean output but no
  additional measurable perf movement (HotSpot was already
  specializing the MethodHandle callsites under JIT).
  See `docs/PIANO_STATUS.md` "JFR frame-count overstates recoverable
  cost" for the three-strike-rule context.

- **Surface dispatcher (when enabled): -2.2 ms per chunk via batched
  heightmap updates.** Replaced per-write `ProtoChunk.setBlockState`
  in `SurfaceDispatcher.flushChunk` (which fires
  `Heightmap.trackUpdate` per write × 2 heightmap types = ~32K calls
  per chunk during SURFACE phase) with a section-grouped raw
  `ChunkSection.setBlockState` loop plus a per-column `trackUpdate`
  post-pass (~512 calls per chunk) — commit `a26e2ee`. Validated
  bit-identical to vanilla per-write `trackUpdate` across **23,204
  chunks combined (21,012 in Step 1 + 2,192 in Step 2 verification),
  100% match, 0 cell mismatches** for both `WORLD_SURFACE_WG` and
  `OCEAN_FLOOR_WG`. Clean post-ship measurement: dispatcher ON
  drops from ~15.6 ms to **~13.4 ms** (-2.2 ms recovered, within the
  source-audit projection of 2-3 ms). Gap to vanilla baseline closed
  from ~9.2 ms to **~7.0 ms** structural floor — palette writes +
  vanilla's `isDefaultBlock` column scanner + biome supplier chain +
  ferrite dispatch ceremony. Surface dispatcher remains default-OFF
  pending architectural work that bypasses the structural floor; the
  lesson from this session was that **counted-O(N) projections from
  source audit are reliable** (this win held on the first try),
  while JFR-frame-count projections are not (three consecutive misses
  documented in `docs/PIANO_STATUS.md`).

- **Noise-sync chunkgen phase: ~8-10 ms/chunk faster** for everyone.
  JFR profiler session (2026-04-28) identified two diagnostic mixins
  firing during the noise-fill phase that contributed combined
  ~8-10 ms/chunk of pure observation overhead in normal play:
  - `CacheRouteCaptureMixin` was running a reflective DF tree walk
    (`DensityFunctionWalker.fingerprint`) per Marker wrap during
    `ChunkNoiseSampler` init — diagnostic for the Phase 2.5 step 2a/2b
    bulk-density experiments which are themselves default-off.
  - `AquiferMonitor` was wrapping every `AquiferSampler.apply` call
    (~98K per chunk) with `@Inject HEAD/RETURN` — pure timing overhead.

  Both gated behind default-off flags (`CacheRouteStats.ENABLED`,
  `AquiferMonitor.ENABLED`). Re-enable only when actively debugging
  density or aquifer work. Cumulative win across exploration,
  pre-gen runs, and new-area loads — every chunk generated.

### Changed

- **Surface dispatcher hot path: biome supplier cache + reused
  `BlockPos.Mutable` + `Identifier.toString` intern.** Dispatcher-
  internal optimisation. Eliminates the duplicated supplier-chain
  resolution and ~30K `BlockPos` allocations per chunk that fired
  per-Y position. Parity validated: 99.9% match vs vanilla,
  java=rust=100%, divergences=0. Measured savings on the dispatcher
  path: ~0.7 ms/chunk (17.7 → 17.0 ms median). Smaller than projected
  because HotSpot had already inlined most of the supplier chain.
  Surface dispatcher remains default-OFF — see `docs/PIANO_STATUS.md`
  "diagnostic gating" section for the full finding and why a
  surface-specific profiler pass is needed before flipping default-on.

### Added

- **`[ferrite] SIMD: avx512f={} avx2={} sse4.2={}` startup log line.**
  One-shot probe at engine init reports the host CPU's SIMD
  capabilities. Decides whether a future SIMD-Perlin port targets
  f64x4 (AVX2) or f64x8 (AVX-512). Diagnostic only — no behaviour
  change today.

- **`PhysicsOracle` parity validator.** Mirrors the aquifer/redstone
  oracle pattern. When `PARITY_MODE=true` (default false), every
  `PhysicsDispatcher.adjust` call shadow-runs the Rust path against
  vanilla and logs `[physics-parity]` mismatches per 5-second window.
  Validated: 100.0000% match across 700K+ dispatches at 1000-mob
  scale; physics dispatcher itself stays default-OFF (would regress
  perf vs vanilla's JIT-inlined path under load).

### Internal

- **Java package layout reorganised into 7 subpackages** (`bridge/`,
  `command/`, `entity/`, `monitor/`, `worldgen/`, `worldgen/chunk/`,
  plus the existing `surface/`, `redstone/`, `mixin/`). Only
  `RustBridge.java` remains at the root package — JNI symbol
  stability (the 30 `Java_me_apika_apikaprobe_RustBridge_*` exports
  in `rust/mod/src/` would all need renaming if it moved). Six
  refactor commits, every commit verified by `compileJava` clean +
  `runClient` confirming `[ferrite] Loaded rust_mod` on boot.
  No behaviour change.

### Added

- **`/ferrite surface heightmap-parity on|off|stats|reset`** —
  regression check for the batched heightmap update path (commit
  `e4e7a41`). When ON, every flushChunk snapshots
  `WORLD_SURFACE_WG` + `OCEAN_FLOOR_WG` pre-flush, runs the
  production batched path, then replays vanilla's per-write
  `trackUpdate` from the snapshot as a reference and diffs cell-by-
  cell. Logs `[surface-heightmap-parity]` lines with running match %
  and mismatch counts. ~1 ms/chunk overhead when on; default OFF.
  Useful if you've changed surface rules and want to confirm the
  predicate-preserving assumption (writes never flip `NOT_AIR` or
  `SUFFOCATES` for the highest Y in a column) still holds.

- **Surface rule dispatcher** (`/ferrite surface dispatch on|off|status`).
  Batched JNI architecture: vanilla's `tryApply` calls are deferred,
  packed into one batch per chunk, evaluated by the Rust bytecode
  evaluator, then written back. Default OFF. Requires
  `/ferrite surface validate` first (uses the installed compiled tree).

  Correctness is solid (vanilla-equivalent terrain at 99.8% match
  vs vanilla per the validator). Performance is the open work item:
  currently ~2.5× chunkgen cost (~25 ms vs vanilla ~10 ms). Default
  flips ON when the seed-driven Track B architecture closes the gap.

- **Xoroshiro128++ Rust port** (`rust/mod/src/xoroshiro.rs`).
  Bit-exact port of vanilla's `Xoroshiro128PlusPlus`,
  `XoroshiroRandomSource`, and `XoroshiroPositionalRandomFactory`.
  11/11 unit tests pass including a hand-traced first-call value
  that matches the Java algorithm exactly. Now drives Rust's
  `OP_VERT_GRADIENT` per-block PRNG (closed the previous Java=Rust
  97.5% gap to **100%**). Foundation for Track B (seed-driven Rust
  dispatcher).

### Changed

- **Surface validator parity: 95.3% → 99.8%** vs vanilla. Four
  reflection / evaluator fixes against the unobfuscated 1.21.11
  source: `getMinSurfaceLevel` → `estimateSurfaceHeight` (yarn
  rename), per-block PRNG for `OP_VERT_GRADIENT` (was midpoint
  placeholder), record-component accessor for vanilla's record-
  typed condition nodes (`Method.invoke` on declared component
  rather than direct field reflection), and live noise sampling
  via cached `DoublePerlinNoiseSampler` references (was zero-vector
  placeholder).

- **Bytecode operand for `OP_VERT_GRADIENT`** grew from 9 → 11 bytes
  (added `u16 randomNameIdx` for per-block PRNG factory lookup).
  `CompiledRuleTree` gained `String[] randomNameTable` to map index
  → registry-name string; resolved at install via reflection on
  vanilla's cached `RandomSplitter` instances.

### Performance

Surface dispatcher A/B (overworld walk-to-load, 4-core CPU
affinity, same methodology as the cramming and redstone
benchmarks). All values are warm averages.

| Architecture | Surface ms/chunk | Δ vs vanilla |
|---|---:|---:|
| Vanilla baseline | ~10-11 ms | — |
| Simple per-call dispatch | ~150-170 ms | 15× regression (captured experiment) |
| Batched JNI | ~70-80 ms | 8× regression |
| + Per-column cache (Opt B) | ~32-37 ms | 3.5× regression |
| + MethodHandle + direct typed Java (Opt A) | ~24-27 ms | **2.5× regression** |

Each iteration documented in `docs/SURFACE_RULE_STATUS.md` under
"Dispatcher swap arc". The remaining regression is dispatch-pipeline
overhead (per-position record allocation, ByteBuffer packing, JNI
hop); the structural fix is Track B.

### Track B (next session)

Seed-driven Rust dispatcher: at world load, push the seed once;
Rust holds its own `NoiseConfig` + `RandomSplitter` stack derived
from that seed. Per chunk Java sends only `(chunk_pos,
position_array)`; Rust computes biome / runDepth / noise / random
from its initialized state and runs the bytecode in one batch.
Foundation (Xoroshiro) is in place. Remaining ports:
`DoublePerlinNoiseSampler`, `NoiseConfig.getOrCreateNoise`,
`MultiNoiseBiomeSource`. Multi-session work.

## [0.5.0-alpha] — 2026-04-23

### Added

- `/ferrite cramming on | off | status` — runtime toggle for the
  batched cramming dispatcher. Lets users A/B Ferrite vs vanilla in
  their own world without restart. Default ON (matches prior
  behavior).

### Changed

- **Cramming is now full vanilla 1:1 parity.** Fixed the two
  outstanding gaps that previously made Ferrite cramming a
  "with-caveat" feature:
  - **Cramming damage is now applied.** Rust returns a per-entity
    `crowdedCount` (overlapping pushable non-passenger pairs);
    Java applies 6.0 cramming damage when
    `crowdedCount > maxEntityCramming - 1` and the per-entity
    `Random.nextInt(4) == 0` fires — bit-for-bit matching vanilla
    `LivingEntity.pushEntities`. Closes the v2 deferral.
  - **`isPassengerOfSameVehicle` skip implemented.** Two mobs sharing
    a root vehicle no longer push each other. Mirrors vanilla
    `Entity.push` line 1822. Schema-friendly (4-byte slot in input
    buffer was unused; no buffer resize).
- Mob → non-mob pushing (items, boats) remains the only documented
  vanilla gap. Edge-case in practice; deferred for a follow-up.

### Fixed

- Cramming damage was failing to fire when mobs spawned at identical
  coordinates (e.g. `/summon zombie ~ ~ ~ ×30`). The push-distance
  early-return in Rust (`f < 0.01`) was running before the
  `crowded_count` increment, so same-position piles registered zero
  overlapping neighbors. Vanilla counts via `getPushableEntities`
  (pure AABB overlap) separately from the push math; mirrored that
  ordering. Regression test added for the exact symptom.

### Verified

**Correctness (small pile, default `maxEntityCramming = 24`):**

- 24 zombies stacked at one block: no damage. ✓ (matches vanilla)
- 25th zombie added: cramming damage fires, mobs die. ✓
- `[cramming-dispatch]` log shows `damaged=N` climbing as the pile
  reaches the threshold and mobs cycle through the 1-in-4 random.

**Perf (~1246-mob pile, 4-core CPU affinity, `/gamerule maxEntityCramming 0`
so mob count stays stable across the A/B; same world, same pile, only
the toggle changed). Two independent runs:**

| State                | Run 1 mspt | Run 1 TPS | Run 2 mspt | Run 2 TPS |
| -------------------- | ---------: | --------: | ---------: | --------: |
| Ferrite ON           | ~48 ms     | **20.00** | ~41 ms     | **20.00** |
| Ferrite OFF (vanilla)| ~75 ms     | **13.3**  | ~58 ms     | **17.0**  |
| Ferrite ON (recover) | ~48 ms     | **20.00** | ~41 ms     | **20.00** |

Direction is identical both runs — vanilla blows past the 50 ms tick
budget and TPS drops; Ferrite stays under it and TPS holds at 20.
Magnitude varies (30–50% mspt reduction) with JIT warmth and system
load.

**Isolated cramming-math sub-budget** (from `[movement-internals] cramming`,
same run): ~0.06 ms with Ferrite vs ~18.81 ms vanilla on the same pile —
roughly **310× reduction in the cramming math itself**, isolated from
the rest of the entity tick. This is the sharpest version of the claim
because it strips out unrelated entity costs.

**Self-serve verification path for users:**

1. Spawn ~1000 zombies (e.g. /summon zombie ~ ~1 ~ from a repeating
   command block with NoAI:1b,PersistenceRequired:1b)
2. /gamerule maxEntityCramming 0   (so mobs don't die during the test)
3. /ferrite cramming on            (default, perf-optimized)
4. Observe TPS / [mspt] log line
5. /ferrite cramming off           (falls back to vanilla)
6. Observe TPS drop / [mspt] climb
7. /ferrite cramming on            (instant recovery)
```

Anyone can reproduce. The toggle is the falsifier.

## [0.4.0-alpha] — 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **Per-cascade Rust BFS now enabled by default** for the AC wire
  algorithm (`FerriteWireConfig.RUST_BFS = true`,
  `RUST_BFS_MIN_NODES = 1`). On heavy redstone workloads, AC's per-
  cascade power propagation now runs in a Rust kernel via one batched
  JNI call per cascade. Java emits the resulting block/shape updates
  unchanged, so user-visible behavior is identical to AC alone.
  Disable with `/ferrite redstone bfs off` if you observe issues on a
  specific contraption.

### Performance

Lag-machine measurement (Ryzen 9 5900X, 4-core CPU affinity, same
methodology as the 0.3.0 redstone numbers). Per-bucket avg cascade
time, three windows (Java baseline → Rust forced → Java cross-check):

| Cascade size | Java       | Rust       | Speedup |
| -----------: | ---------: | ---------: | ------: |
| 1–4 nodes    | 0.009 ms   | 0.007 ms   | 1.29×   |
| 5–8 nodes    | 0.023 ms   | 0.015 ms   | 1.53×   |
| 9–16 nodes   | 0.052 ms   | 0.034 ms   | 1.53×   |
| 17–32 nodes  | 0.052 ms   | 0.025 ms   | 2.08×   |

Aggregate: avg cascade time drops from 0.020 ms to 0.014 ms, **and**
cascade throughput rises from ~240K to ~340K per 5 s window — the
server tick has more headroom, so more cascades fit per second.

Oracle reports 0 mismatches across the entire experiment; output is
bit-for-bit identical to AC-Java and to vanilla on the validated
windows.

### Caveats

- **Workload-shape dependent.** Measured on a sustained high-volume
  lag machine. A 64-wire repeater clock measurement showed Rust
  ~20µs per-cascade slower (0.026 ms → 0.046 ms) on cold/bursty small
  cascades — likely JIT warmup-bound on the Rust glue path. Absolute
  cost is imperceptible (<0.05 ms / tick) but if you have a
  contraption that regresses, `/ferrite redstone bfs off` reverts to
  AC-Java without restart.
- **Manual override.** `/ferrite redstone bfs-min <n>` raises the
  per-cascade size threshold above which Rust takes over. Set high
  to gate the Rust path out for small cascades while keeping AC's
  Java algorithm.

See [docs/REDSTONE_PORT_PLAN.md](docs/REDSTONE_PORT_PLAN.md) Phase 2c
for the full per-bucket data and methodology.

## [0.3.0-alpha] — 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Alternate Current wire algorithm** — adapted from
  [Space Walker's Alternate Current](https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current)
  (MIT, attributed in [LICENSES.md](LICENSES.md)). Installed
  transparently as a `DefaultRedstoneController` subclass via a
  `@Redirect(NEW)` mixin on `RedstoneWireBlock`'s controller field;
  existing worlds with vanilla redstone dust pick up the new algorithm
  with no migration or world-creation toggle.
- `/ferrite redstone ac on | off | status` — runtime toggle for the AC
  path. Default OFF. Op-level 2.
- `[redstone-oracle]` shadow-compute correctness checker — validates
  every sampled wire against vanilla's `calculateWirePowerAt` and logs
  per-window node mismatches. Active whenever AC or the Rust BFS is on.
- `[redstone]` phase monitor — wire cascade counts (split by
  gate-driven vs direct, default vs experimental controller), gate
  scheduled-tick durations, server-ticks per 5s window.
- `[redstone-rust]` dispatcher liveness counter — confirms whether the
  Rust BFS path is actually firing when enabled.

### Performance

Measured on the reference redstone lag machine (default controller,
no experimental toggle), Ryzen 9 5900X limited to 4 active cores via
CPU affinity — the same constrained-hardware baseline used for all
prior Ferrite benchmarks. Single A/B run, 5s windows:

| Metric                | Vanilla default      | AC (Ferrite)          | Change                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------: | --------------------: | ------------------------- |
| Cascades / tick       | ~127,000             | ~8,250                | ~15× fewer                |
| Gate throughput / tick| ~663                 | ~2,780                | ~4× more                  |
| Wire cost / gate tick | ~0.378 ms            | ~0.062 ms             | ~84% less                 |
| Effective TPS         | ~4                   | ~5.6                  | **+40%**                  |
| Oracle mismatches     | —                    | 0 / 149,669 checked   | bit-for-bit correct       |
| Vanilla controller    | active               | `default=0`           | fully bypassed            |

Two independent effects combine in the user-visible result:

1. **Gate throughput per server tick rises ~4×** — each wire cascade
   now collapses into a single network settle (~84% less wire time per
   gate tick), so the same per-tick budget processes more gate ticks.
   Contraptions animate faster at equivalent server load.

2. **Server TPS rises ~40% on CPU-bound hardware** — when the server
   is actually saturated (as it is on a 4-core baseline running a
   redstone lag machine), wire-cost savings convert directly into more
   completed ticks per second. A run on unconstrained hardware showed
   the TPS delta vanishing (~5 → ~5) because there was headroom; the
   gate-throughput win persisted.

`default=0` in every AC window confirms vanilla's `DefaultRedstoneController`
is completely bypassed; the @Redirect installation mixin is doing its
job.

### Investigated

- **Per-cascade Rust BFS for redstone** — correct output
  (327K checks, 0 mismatches) but ~10× slower than vanilla at per-call
  granularity; JNI round-trip overhead exceeds the per-cascade compute
  saving. Shipped disabled. Infrastructure retained
  ([rust/mod/src/redstone.rs](rust/mod/src/redstone.rs),
  `RedstoneRustDispatcher`) in case a within-cascade batched approach
  becomes worth attempting. See
  [docs/REDSTONE_PORT_PLAN.md](docs/REDSTONE_PORT_PLAN.md) for the
  full analysis.
- **Predictive chunk pre-loading** — movement-vector ticket
  submission. 150–300 ms of headroom on dedicated servers, but
  vanilla's own scheduler already reaches `FULL` status in 3–6 ticks
  regardless of how early tickets arrive, so no meaningful TPS impact
  was measurable. Ships enabled for ongoing measurement across user
  configurations; disable via `PreChunkDispatcher.ENABLED = false`.

## [0.1.2-alpha] — 2026-04-19

Cross-platform native support. No gameplay changes; Linux and macOS
users get the cramming speedup Windows users already had.

### Added

- Linux native: `librust_mod.so` at `/assets/ferrite/natives/linux/`.
- macOS universal native (aarch64 + x86_64 via `lipo -create`) at
  `/assets/ferrite/natives/macos/`.
- Host-aware Gradle `buildRustLib` — picks the correct target triple
  per host OS.
- Four-job CI pipeline: three parallel per-platform native builds and
  one assembly job.

### Changed

- `RustBridge.loadNativeLibrary` selects the per-OS resource path at
  runtime. Unsupported platforms log clearly and fall back to pure Java.
- `.cargo/config.toml` — removed the Windows-only `[build] target`
  default; retained the GNU linker spec for the GNU target.
- `SETUP_MINGW.md` now covers all three supported platforms.

### Known limitations

- Linux x86_64 only; no aarch64 Linux build yet.
- Cramming damage (max-entity-cramming rule) still deferred from 0.1.1.

---

## [0.2.0-alpha] — 2026-04-19

First gameplay-affecting release.

### Added

- **Cramming Rust port.** `LivingEntity.tickCramming` is batched once
  per server tick and evaluated in a Rust spatial-hash push
  accumulator. Vanilla's push formula is preserved exactly (Chebyshev
  distance, 0.05 scale).
  - Measured at 1000+ mobs: `tickCramming` cost 14 ms → 0.03 ms;
    total entity tick 60 ms → 21 ms; TPS holds at 20.
- `[movement-internals]` log — seven-bucket breakdown of
  `LivingEntity.tickMovement` (`cramming`, `blockCollision`,
  `navigator`, `move`, `adjustColl`, `travel`, `gravity`, computed
  `other`).
- `[cramming-dispatch]` log — per-window batch count, total mobs
  processed, pushed count.
- `EntityAdjustInvoker` — `@Invoker` accessor interface providing a
  bypass-the-redirect path for vanilla fallback. Reusable pattern for
  future per-method Rust ports.

### Changed

- `CrammingMixin`'s timing hooks disable themselves when
  `CrammingDispatcher.ENABLED` is true, preventing ThreadLocal timer
  imbalance with the cancel-mixin.

### Investigated

- **Entity collision-adjust Rust port** — full JNI pipeline, AABB
  sweep engine, and chunk-section snapshot model implemented and
  correctness-verified (18K dispatches, zero fallback). Benchmark
  showed snapshot cost dominates sweep savings at realistic mob
  counts (~80 ms/tick overhead vs ~8 ms/tick win). Shipped disabled
  (`PhysicsDispatcher.ENABLED = false`); retained for a future
  invalidation-cache redesign.

### Known limitations

- `maxEntityCramming` game-rule damage not applied while the Rust
  cramming path is active (1.21.11 API churn).

---

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-04-18

First public alpha. Instrumentation-only research mod. Windows 64-bit.

### Added

- Performance monitors, each logged under the `[ferrite]` prefix on a
  5-second window: `[chunkgen]`, `[client-lag]`, `[entity-render]`,
  `[mspt]`, `[rust-engine]`.
- Rust native library bundled at
  `assets/ferrite/natives/rust_mod.dll`; extracted and loaded at
  runtime. Non-Windows platforms load cleanly with native features
  disabled.
- Automatic Rust build integration — `./gradlew build` invokes
  `cargo build --release` and bundles the resulting DLL.
- Mixin instrumentation on `NoiseChunkGenerator`, `ChunkNoiseSampler`,
  `AquiferSampler$Impl`, and `EntityRenderManager`.

### Build

- Toolchain pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`
  (`nightly-2025-08-29`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`).
- GNU linker pinned in `.cargo/config.toml`.
- Dev-run heap capped at 3 GB to simulate low-end hardware for
  comparable baselines across sessions.

### Known limitations

- Windows 64-bit only.
- No gameplay changes; instrumentation only.
- No log-verbosity toggle.

### License

- MIT. Changed from CC0-1.0 used in the pre-release research branch.

## Pre-release history

Ferrite grew out of the `rust-mod-probe` research project. Notable
pre-release milestones are preserved in the `ferrite` / `main` branch
history. The full architectural investigation is documented in
[docs/PROFILING.md](docs/PROFILING.md).
