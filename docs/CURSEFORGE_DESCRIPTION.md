## Ferrite

A performance mod for Minecraft 26.2 (Fabric, JDK 25). Java handles integration and mixins; native Rust does the heavy per-tick math where crossing the JNI boundary actually pays. Server-side compatible: install on a server, players don't need it.

**Headline numbers, all measured on real worlds:**

* **Cramming** (default on): ~65% entity-tick reduction at 1000+ packed mobs. Bit-for-bit vanilla push math.
* **Entity queries** (default on since 0.7.3): a spatial index in front of vanilla's entity lookups, plus a collider skip that fires only when the answer is provably empty. A 1022-zombie farm on a shared 4-core server went from 15.5 TPS at 64 ms/tick to a locked 20 TPS at 31 ms. Zero mismatches across 10.8M oracle checks; the oracle keeps sampling at 1 in 16 during alpha. Kill switches: `-Dferrite.entityquery.cache=false` and `-Dferrite.entityquery.colliderskip=false`.
* **Redstone** (`/ferrite redstone ac on`): Alternate Current algorithm plus a Rust BFS kernel. A lag machine that held vanilla at 1.4-1.8 TPS recovered to a flat 20.00 TPS. Zero mismatches across 150,000+ oracle checks. Off by default so contraptions tuned to vanilla update order keep working.
* **Hoppers** (default on): extract loops skip drained slots, up to ~85% cheaper on partially-emptied chests. Opt-in hopper highway multiplies chain throughput ~3x for storage systems.
* **Idle sign and furnace tickers suppressed** (default on): ~70% block-entity tick reduction at scale, self-healing, mod-subclass safe.
* **Pre-gen and predictive chunk forcing** (opt-in): 90-118 chunks/s spawn pre-generation with resume, and a generation ring that leads your flight path, so terrain is usually already generated ahead of you.

Worldgen math (noise, biomes, density functions) is ported bit-exact and validated every release; parity checks run 63/63 noise and 50/50 density on 26.2.

**Every 5 seconds the mod logs where your tick time goes**, so optimization targets real bottlenecks. Runtime toggle: `/ferrite log monitors off`.

## Requirements

* Minecraft 26.2 (26.1.2 and 1.21.11 builds available as older releases)
* Java 25, Fabric Loader 0.19.5+, Fabric API 0.154.2+26.2
* Singleplayer and multiplayer

## Platforms

Natives bundled for Windows x86_64, Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64 (tested on a Raspberry Pi 4B), and macOS (universal). If the native fails to load, Ferrite falls back to vanilla behavior automatically, so a missing native cannot crash the game or damage a world.

## How to help

Play 10+ minutes with mob farms or crowded worlds, open `logs/ferrite.log` (Ferrite's own log), and share the `[cramming-dispatch]` and `[entity-tick]` lines in a GitHub issue. Low-end hardware reports are especially useful.
